    The table store is responsible for storing and retrieving various types
    of tabular data. Additionally, it also has to manage all task metadata,

    A store must use a table's name (`table.name`) and stage (`table.stage`)
    as the primary keys for storing and retrieving it. This means that
    two different `Table` objects can be used to store and retrieve the same
    data as long as they have the same name and stage.

    The same is also true for the task metadata where the task `stage`,
    `version` and `cache_key` act as the primary keys (those values are
    stored both in the task object and the metadata object).

    To implement the stage transaction and commit mechanism, a technique
    called schema swapping is used:

    All outputs from materializing tasks get materialized into a temporary
    empty schema (`stage.transaction_name`) and only if all tasks have
    finished running *successfully* you swap the 'base schema' (original stage,
    or cache) with the 'transaction schema'. This is usually done by renaming
    them.
