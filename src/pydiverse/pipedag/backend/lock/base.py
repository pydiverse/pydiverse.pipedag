    LOCKED:

        The lock manager isn't certain about the state of the lock. This
        can, for example, happen if a lock manager requires a connection to
        the internet and this connection is interrupted.

        the resource isn't locked anymore and pause until the lock transitions
        to a different state.

        The lock has been invalidated. This means that a lock that was LOCKED
        has been unlocked for some unexpected reason. A common transition
