# Changelog

## 0.6.7 (2023-MM-DD)
- Make separator customizable when splitting RawSql into statements.
- Add `DropNickname` for DB2 and drop nicknames when dropping schemas.
- Add debug function `materialize_table`.
- Update install instructions and dependencies to enable DB2 and mssql development on OS X with an `arm64` architecture.
- Update PR template
- Run `RUNSTATS` on every DB2 table after creation

## 0.6.6 (2023-08-17)
- Implement support for loading polars dataframes from DuckDB.
- Accelerate storing of dataframes (pandas and polars) to DuckDB (10-100x speedup).
- Fix `TypeError` being raised when using pydiverse transform SQLTableImpl together with a local table cache. 

## 0.6.5 (2023-08-16)
- Implemented automatic versioning of tasks by setting task version to [](#AUTO_VERSION).
  This feature is currently only supported by Polars [`LazyFrame`](inv:pl#reference/lazyframe/index) and by Pandas.
- Added [](#kroki_url) config option.

## 0.6.4 (2023-08-07)
- Allow invocation of undecorated task functions when calling task object outside of flow definition context.
- Rename `ignore_fresh_input` to `ignore_cache_function`.
- Fix race condition leading to `JSONDecodeError` in [](#ParquetTableCache) when setting `store_input: true` together with the `DaskEngine`.
- Fix running subset of tasks not working due to tables and blobs being retrieved from wrong schema.

## 0.6.3 (2023-07-25)
- Fix crash during config initialization when using [](#DatabaseLockManager) together with `PostgreSQL`.

## 0.6.2 (2023-07-23)
- Switch back to using numpy nullable dtypes for Pandas as default.
- Ensure that indices get created in same schema as corresponding table (IBM Db2).
- Fix private method `SQLTableStore.get_stage_hash`.

## 0.6.1 (2023-07-19)
- Create initial documentation for pipedag.
- Remove stage argument from [](#RawSql) initializer.
- Add [](#RawSql) to public API.
- Fix [](#PrefectTwoEngine) failing on retrieval of results.
- Added [](#Flow.get_stage()), and [](#Stage.get_task()) methods.
- Added [](#MaterializingTask.get_output_from_store()) method to allow retrieval of task output without running the Flow.
- Created [](#TableReference) to simplify complex table loading operations.
- Allow for easy retrieval of tables generated by [](#RawSql). 
  Passing a RawSql object into a task results in all tables that were generated by the RawSql to be dematerialized.
  The tables can then be accessed using `raw_sql["table_name"]`.
  Alternatively, the same syntax can also be used during flow definition to only pass in a specific table. 
- Fix private method `SQLTableStore.get_stage_hash` not working for IBM DB2.

## 0.6.0 (2023-07-07)
- Added [`delete-schemas`](#reference/cli:delete-schemas) command to `pipedag-manage` to help with cleaning up database
- Remove all support for mssql database swapping. 
  Instead, we now properly support schema swapping.
- Fix UNLOGGED tables not working with Postgres.
- Added `hook_args` section to `table_store` part of config file to support passing config arguments to table hooks.
- Added `dtype_backend` hook argument for `PandasTableHook` to overriding the default pandas dtype backend to use.
- Update raw sql metadata table (`SQLTableStore`).
- Remove `engine_dispatch` and replace with SQLTableStore subclasses.
- Moved local table cache from `pydiverse.pipedag.backend.table_cache` to `pydiverse.pipedag.backend.table.cache` namespace.
- Changed order in which flow / instance config gets resolved.

## 0.5.0 (2023-06-28)
- add support for DuckDB
- add support for pyarrow backed pandas dataframes
- support execution of subflow
- store final state of task in flow result object
- tasks now have a `position_hash` associated with them to identify them purely based on their position (e.g. stage, name and input wiring) inside a flow.
- breaking change to metadata: added position_hash to `tasks` metadata table and change type of hash columns from String(32) to String(20).
- `Flow`, `Subflow`, and `Result` objects now provide additional options for visualizing them
- added `unlogged_tables` flag to SQLTableStore for creating UNLOGGED tables with Postgres.
- created [`pipedag-manage`](#reference/cli) command line utility with [`clear-metadata`](#reference/cli:clear-metadata) command to help with migrating between different pipedag metadata versions.

## 0.4.1 (2023-06-17)
- implement [](#DaskEngine): orchestration engine for running multiple tasks in parallel
- implement [](#DatabaseLockManager): lock manager based on locking mechanism provided by database

## 0.4.0 (2023-06-08)
- update public interface
- encrypt IPC communication
- remove preemptive `os.makedirs` from ParquetTableCache
- improve logging and provide structlog utilities

## 0.3.0 (2023-05-25)
- breaking change to pipedag.yaml:
  introduced `args` subsections for arguments that are passed to backend classes
- fix ibm_db_sa bug when copying dataframes from cache: uppercase table names by default
- nicer readable SQL queries: use automatic aliases for inputs of SQLAlchemy tasks
- implement option ignore_task_version: disable eager task caching for some instances to reduce overhead from task version bumping
- implement local table cache: store input/output of dataframe tasks in parquet files and allow using it as cache to avoid rereading from database

## 0.2.4 (2023-05-05)
- fix errors by increasing output_json length in metadata table
- fix cache invalidation: query normalization before checking for changes
- add rudimentary support for ibis tasks (postgres + mssql)
- add rudimentary support for polars + tidypolars tasks
- implemented pandas type mapping to avoid row wise type checks of object columns
- support pandas 2.0 (no arrow features used that)
- support sqlalchemy 2.0 (except for with polars)

## 0.2.3 (2023-04-17)
- fixed python 3.9 compatibility (`traceback.format_exception` syntax changed)
- fixed deferred table copy when task is invalid (introduced with 0.2.2)
- fixed mssql to not reflect full schema while renamings happen
- fixed clearing of metadata tables for lazy tables and raw sql tables
- fixed mssql synonym resolution when reading input table for pandas task
- initial implementation of issue #62: make query canonical before hashing
- retry some DB calls in case they are aborted as deadlock victim

## 0.2.2 (2023-03-31)
- added option `avoid_drop_create_schema` to table store configuration
- improve performance when working with IBM DB2 dialect (i.e. table locking)
- prevent table copying and schema swapping for 100% cache valid stages

## 0.2.1 (2023-01-15)
- removed contextvars dependency (not needed for python >= 3.7 and broke conda-forge build)

## 0.2.0 (2023-01-14)
- `SQLTableStore`: support for Microsoft SQL Server and IBM DB2 (Linux) database connection strings
- Support primary keys and indexes (can be configured with Table object and used in custom RawSql code)
- `RawSql`: support additional return type for `@materialize` tasks which allows to emit raw SQL string including multiple create statements (currently, views/functions/procedures are only supported for dialect mssql). 
   This feature should only be used for getting legacy code running in pipedag before converting it to programatically generated or manual SELECT statements.
- Support pytsql library for executing raw SQL scripts with `dialect=mssql` (i.e. supports PRINT capture)
- Manual Cache Invalidation for source nodes:
  `@materialize(cache=f)` parameter can take an arbitrary function that gets the same arguments as the task function and returns a hash. 
  If the hash is different from for the previous run, the task is considered cache invalid.
- New configuration file format pipedag.yaml can be used to configure multiple pipedag instances: see docs/reference/config.rst

## 0.1.0 (2022-09-01)
Initial release.

- `@materialize` annotations
- flow definition with nestable stages
- zookeeper synchronization
- postgres database backend
- Prefect 1.x and 2.x support
- multi-processing/multi-node support for state exchange between `@materialize` tasks
